# CubeVision
An easy way to visualise a texture mapped to a cube

## So what is this?
A (relatively) small Processing program that can load image files and map them to a cube.
## How do I use it?
Easy! Launch the program and you'll be greeted by a cube. This isn't really that interesting until you grab it with your mouse and move it around. Holding the left mouse button and dragging will pan around; holding the right mouse button and dragging will rotate.
## Uhh... alright, but what if I want to use my own texture?
*Also* easy! Hit 'o' (the letter 'o' as in open, not zero) once you're in the program and choose a texture. Textures can be either 3x2 or 2x2.

> When talking about textures sizes, the numbers above represent the number of sides. For example, a texture could be 64px square, which would load as four 32px square textures.

Textures can be pretty much any size, so long as they follow the ratios above. Of course, you can also load any old picture and it will attempt to make it work, but very small images or excessively tall/wide pictures will produce funny but less than optimal results.

*Refer to the template folder for example textures and Photoshop files*
